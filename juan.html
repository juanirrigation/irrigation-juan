            <h2>Introduction to Tomato Planting</h2>
            <p>Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) are a vital crop in the Philippines, both economically and nutritionally. They are a rich source of vitamins A and C, potassium, and folate. The tropical climate of the Philippines, characterized by its warm temperatures and significant rainfall, is conducive to tomato farming. However, to maximize yield and quality, proper cultivation practices are essential.</p>
            <p>Tomatoes thrive in well-drained, fertile soils with a pH range of 6.0 to 6.8. They require full sunlight for at least 6 to 8 hours a day. Regular monitoring for pests and diseases is also crucial, as tomatoes are susceptible to various issues such as blight, leaf spot, and fruit rot.</p>

            <h2>Precision Irrigation</h2>
            <p>Precision irrigation is a key technique in modern agriculture, aimed at providing the optimal amount of water to crops at the right time. This method not only conserves water but also enhances crop growth and yield by preventing over- or under-watering.</p>
            <p>For tomatoes, precision irrigation involves using drip or micro-sprinkler systems that deliver water directly to the root zone. These systems can be automated and controlled using soil moisture sensors and weather data to ensure efficient water use. Benefits of precision irrigation include reduced water consumption, lower energy costs, and improved plant health and productivity.</p>

            <h2>Tomato Water Requirements</h2>
            <p>Understanding the water requirements of tomatoes is essential for successful cultivation. Tomatoes have different water needs at various growth stages. During the fifth month, when the plants are likely in the fruiting stage, adequate water is crucial to support fruit development and prevent physiological disorders such as blossom-end rot.</p>
